# mpstk - the MultiParty Session Types toolKit

mpstk is a toolkit for **specifying multiparty protocols** and
**verifying their properties** (e.g., deadlock-freedom and liveness).

The original mpstk is based on the **generalised theory of multiparty session
types** presented in the companion paper:

*  Alceste Scalas and Nobuko Yoshida.
   [Less is More: Multiparty Session Types Revisited](https://doi.org/10.1145/3290343).
   POPL 2019.

For details and documentation on the original tool, please visit the home page of the tool:

This version is a development version extended by Julia Gabet for their PhD thesis. 
Most capabilities of the extension have been implemented, but some might be in a 
crude state and were not thoroughly tested due to time constraints when the work 
was done. It is provided as-is and no support is offered currently, as no further 
work on the theory or the tool is planned at the current time. 

For questions on the workings of the extension, please send a message to:
